# snips-node-handlers-api

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gjdass/snips-node-handlers-api.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gjdass/snips-node-handlers-api)

## Just a start
The aim is to build a full featured and easy to code/understand API to work with [Snips.ai](https://snips.ai), an open source and __privacy compliant__ voice recognition system (everything happens locally).

## What you need
* A Raspberry-pi, or a Linux machine, with raspbian/debian on it
* To install snips on it (see their doc, maybe i'll write some here one day)
* An AWS account (free one) to use Polly text-to-speech
* Clone this repo
* Start to have fun
