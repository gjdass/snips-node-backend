__Work in progress__

This is just a start, code (I mean the 100 lines) is ugly as f**k, I'll iterate on it.

# snips-node-handlers-api
An API built to handle all kind of snips.ai requests

## Just a start
The aim is to build a full featured and easy to code/understand API to work with [Snips.ai](https://snips.ai), an open source and __privacy compliant__ voice recognition system (everything happens locally).

## What you need
* A Raspberry-pi, or a Linux machine, with raspbian/debian on it
* To install snips on it (see their doc, maybe i'll write some here one day)
* An AWS account (free one) to use Polly text-to-speech
* Clone this repo
* Start to have fun
